      "The objectives of this course are: 1) To review basic and essential literature pertinent to current issues in dental education, 2) To provide information to residents on applying foundational concepts of education to the design of a dental curriculum,  3) To better enable the correlation of clinical and didactic education with evidence-based literature and outcomes assessments, and 4) To enable students to stay on top of current issues, and continue to review the history of dental education. We will focus on reviewing dental pedagogy, curriculum planning, and critically assessing scientific papers.",

      "Data Science 1 is the first half of a one-year introduction to data science. The course will focus on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Material covered will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: (1) data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set;  (2) data management - accessing data quickly and reliably; (3) exploratory data analysis - generating hypotheses and building intuition; (4) prediction or statistical learning; and (5) communication - summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Part one of a two part series. The curriculum for this course builds throughout the academic year. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in both the fall and spring course within the same academic year. Part one of a two part series.",

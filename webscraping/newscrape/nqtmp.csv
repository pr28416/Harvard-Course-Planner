Regardless of your own academic trajectory, the readings and discussions in this course will be relevant to your work and complicate/enrich your approach to your own study. At times, the course felt like a survey course—taking on themes of gender, urbanism, migration, and environmental change one at a time. On a weekly basis, this course does not demand a lot of work as there are usually only a couple of short–medium journal articles/book chapters to read. Discussion posts are flexible and generative and assignments are not overly long.\n\nWhile I am glad I took this course, I would have a couple of reservations in recommending this class to peers. First, the Professor has a habit of jumping into discussions so frequently that students became hesitant to speak. At times, discussions felt stifled by this dynamic and seemed to drag on despite the general interest in the topics being discussed. Changes to discussion formatting could improve this and it certainly wasn't a deal breaker. Additionally, assignment feedback was pretty minimal and if you are looking for a class to dramatically improve your academic writing, this likely would not be it.

The readings are really short but they're hit and miss and much of class time will be spent listening to the professor speak generally about tangentially related topics. If there is a very specific topic related to mobility you're looking to explore, then maybe this is a good class for you —you could do this through the papers and presentations, of which there are many—but otherwise you won't gain a rigorous understanding of the material."", 'interesting readings! if you have anything related to mobility studies in mind already that you want to explore further, the essays are a nice place to do so because daniel provides purposefully open–ended essay prompts that you can run with.']"

Specific students are targeted in the course and are harassed for how they speak and for the contributions they make. It’s also listed as a discussion course, but Professor Eatmon simply cancels discussion. This makes it uncomfortable to speak.\n\nThe course provides no flexibility and Professor Eatmon makes it difficult for you to ask for an extension for assignments. She also tediously marks for attendance, including lateness. This matters more for your participation grade than what you actually include in the course. She would rather students not come at all than come late or need to leave intermediately for medical for medical or other reasons.\n\nThe classroom is not an open space. Feedback was met with pushback. I think we all hoped for acceptance and a place where discussion was allowed to occur. This was not the environment for that.\n\nFurther, there is no flexibility in terms of lateness and extensions. This creates a burden for students who experience health conditions and family issues throughout the semester. As the course stands, several students were denied needed extensions for coursework for sickness, death, and other issues in their lives and their families.\n\nClass time was also used to stream full documentaries in the course. Because the Professor would not sleep or would otherwise not want to lecture, we would sit through documentary films unrelated to course material.\n\n\nThere is little discussion of Jim Crow within the course even though it is described as a course about Jim Crow. We spent more time on present–day issues than history and barely discussed Black history after Reconstruction.\n\nI would prefer to see a consistent policy on slurs in the classroom. Professor Eatmon full on said slurs against multiple groups in the class that were not Black. Black students couldn't say the n–word but she would say multiple slurs.\n\nFurther, the documentaries and high–school–level videos we watched were not applicable.\n\nProfessor Eatmon expects us to put her course above everything else in our lives, including our well–being and other coursework.

To take this course, you have to commit to always being right on the dot for class and agree with her in every class."", ""Definitely take this class!

It's a lighter courseload than some other AFVS classes in the department and is a great introduction. We had lots of creative freedom and Katarina provides great advice and feedback. The course also provides art supplies, invited live models for gestures, and allowed us to play with so many different mediums. We also got the chance to visit the art museum during class and visit exhibitions! 100% would recommend, but it is a class where you get what you put into the course. Sure, you can slack off, but it's not worth it."", 'This is a fantastic class for those who are beginners in drawing and for those who want to expand upon previous skill. I truly felt at home in this class and comfortable trying new things and making art.', ""Take this class! You'll have a great time and get to talk about and create artwork!"", 'A great course for anyone who has an affinity for drawing they want to expand upon. The class teaches you how to look at art and widens your artistic pallet, introduces you to new artists and ideas, and helps refine your technique and skill. The course begins with drawing exercises on perspective, shadow etc. including several figuring drawing sessions with models. The later part of the course focuses on creating pieces and ends with the final project, an opportunity to create and curate a body of work. I learned a lot from my classmates, who all had their unique styles and directions that they developed over the class. Katarina does a great job of helping you break out of your habits and expand your visual vocabulary with very personalized feedback. This class also has a great atmosphere and benefits from its small size. It can be a lot of work, but if you are into drawing and can fit this in your schedule it’s good homework to be doing since all the assignments involve actually drawing (rather than writing or whatnot). Also you get free materials. Take it!']"

It is impossible to read the political landscape in American life and not engage with the work of black culture from film to sculptures, public installations to paintings.
This course focuses on the visual work of racial politics as a critical technology for contestation, redress, and rights-based advocacy in the United States. It addresses the founding of the United States through the works of contemporary artists from Gordon Parks to Isaac Julien, Mark Bradford, Hank Willis Thomas, and Amy Sherald.
The final portion of the class will give students an opportunity to present exhibitions proposals about artists who perform this critical work in American life or submit a 15-20 page research paper.
This course method represents a change in how we can study the arts and humanities today. It was once possible to produce scholarship on vision and visuality in the United States as if it was somehow sealed off from the discursive force of racial formation. It is not any longer. In the 1990s, a methodological shift occurred as scholars including but not limited to Martin Berger, Maurice Berger, Kirsten Pai Buick, Eddie Chambers, Hal Foster, Édouard Glissant, Kellie Jones, Nicholas Mirzoeff, W. J. T. Mitchell, Toni Morrison, Steven Nelson, Michele Wallace, and Deborah Willis began to focus on the polemics, process, and construction of vision, absence, and opacity in the history of racial formation and social power.
The dual aim of this course is to give students-undergraduate and graduate-of all backgrounds and concentrations an understanding of core topics in Black Art, and a critical understanding of the imbrication of visuality, race, and politics in the United States through a series of case studies.

Language serves as a road map to comprehending how social, political, and economic processes like kinship structures, the evolution of political offices, trade relations, and environmental knowledge develop. Oral histories and cultural and intellectual products like novels, music, poems, essays, films, and photographs offer opportunities to open eyes to, interact with, listen and speak to, and think alongside Africans they entrepreneurs, artists, authors, teachers, thinkers as they uncover, communicate, and debate the major topics and issues facing African societies and people today.
As a Social Engagement course, AAAS 20 will wed scholarly inquiry and academic study to practical experience and personal involvement in the community. Students will be given the opportunity to study Africans, their languages, and their cultures from the ground up, not only through textbooks and data sets but through personal relationships, cultural participation, and inquisitive explorations of local African heritage communities with Harvard's African Language Program instructors as guides. Throughout the semester you will be asked to employ video production, ethnographic research, creative writing, “social-portraiture,” GIS mapping, and linguistic study as you engage with Africans, their languages, and their cultures. By examining individual lives of select Africans, linguistic debates, cultural traditions and interrogating their import in the daily lives of Boston-area Africans, we hope to bridge the divide between grand theories and everyday practices, between intellectual debates and the lived experiences of individuals, between the American academy and the African world.

What lessons can we learn from landscape practices in various African societies that can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and social inequities? (3.)

In this course, we will employ a structure of text and critique to evaluate the reach and utility of his ideas, on subjects ranging from the development of racial consciousness to nuclear disarmament to the international order and the role of Africa, Africans, and African Americans in it. This course will examine Du Bois’s original writings in the context of the debates they sparked and will revisit his interactions with key figures, both Black and white, of the twentieth century.",,https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu/home/courses?school=FAS&search=AFRAMER+177,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,African & African Amer Studies,African & African Amer Studies,Cambridge Campus,4,Seminar,,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,,,,,,,

How can this model apply to other minority vanguardist literatures? What is or what was the avant-garde? How should we read that phrase today? Recent debates in Black Studies over temporality, periodization, affect, and antagonism, suggest that we may not have an adequate theory of the avant-garde, or at least we may need to update the ones we inherit from Renato Poggioli (1968) and Peter Bürger (1984) in their accounts of the historical formation of European vanguards. By revisiting the avant-garde, we renew a concept that touches on a wealth of topics of interest to contemporary theoretical and methodological debates: taste, politics, publics and counter-publics, signifying, archives, transnationalism, translation, incompleteness, failure, and the circulation and manipulation of new medias. There are also the classic questions: Who gets to decide what constitutes an ""avant-garde"" or avant-gardes? What is the relationship between avant-garde artistic movements and political or militant ones? This course will explore these themes comparatively, with readings drawn from poems, plays, novels, films, and ranging widely across the African diaspora, South and East Asia, the Caribbean, and Latin America.

We will work with paper and cardboard, and then with wood, plaster, clay and a variety of other mold-making, casting and sculpting materials.
We each walk into a circumstance with a given set of expectations concerning success and failure; expectations we have of ourselves, and expectations we believe others have of us personally, institutionally, culturally. These often become the driving force behind our actions. If we take time to explore the nature of these performance expectations and flip them on their heads, they can become the basis for rich and thorough artistic pursuit.

What makes them succeed (or fail)? For whom do they work? Why do we perform them? Which experiences do rituals elicit? In this class, we will explore these questions, by looking at evidence from the ancient world in light of modern theories of ritual. The study of ritual draws from many disciplines, ranging from religion, philosophy, anthropology, and history to sociology, psychology, and biology. We will draw connections between all these disciplines and the ancient data, so as to come to a broader understanding of what ritual is and how it works.
In this seminar, we will focus on specific ancient rituals (e.g., the New Year Festival); on specific types of ritual (e.g., royal ritual); and on broader trends underlying ritual (e.g., magic). We will explore what these case studies reveal about ritual in general, connecting the ancient world to our modern experience. We will also dwell on the question of how we can study ritual through ancient data. How does ritual performance relate to text? How does material culture help us to study ritual practice?

Through concrete case studies and practical exercises students will be introduced to different approaches to developing research problems, conducting research, and ethnographic writing. Topics covered will include defining research questions and objects of study, situating projects within scholarly literature, and bringing together research data and analysis in different forms of anthropological writing.
The aim of the course is not an exhaustive overview of research design but to familiarize students with some of the key practices and concerns of anthropological research and writing. The course seeks to guide students in reading anthropological texts, understanding the range of data and its representations, unpacking the analytical moves being made in the text, and thinking through the implications of such presentation.
The course is divided into two main components. The first focuses on a case study of a developing anthropological work by the instructor. Through select readings related to their topic of interest and original research documents (proposals, fieldnotes, media, news reports, photographs, analytical essays, among others) students will learn the process of turning a research question into an anthropological project. The case study is also meant to prepare students for the experience of conducting their own research and serve as an example of how to transform research findings into anthropological writing.
Simultaneously, this course is also a research practicum in which students will apply what they have learned to design their own anthropological projects and share with each other research goals, experiences, and components of their emerging work. Through structured assignments, seminar workshops, and regular individual meetings with their instructor students will produce an original research essay based on their research over the course of the semester.",,https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu/home/courses?school=FAS&search=ANTHRO+98,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,Anthropology,Anthropology,Cambridge Campus,4,Tutorial,FAS Letter Graded,Not Available for Cross Registration, 12/12/2023 2:00 PM,No Limit,,Required of all concentrators in Anthropology.,,,

Our goal is to develop, in collaboration with enrolled students, a pedagogy for fostering students’ personal quests for wisdom, through lectures and readings, through extensive conversation, and also through other experiences inside and outside of class, including dramaturgical experiences with film or theater, caregiving, and meditation.
As teachers we are inspired by William James’s conception of knowledge in the University as intended forstrategies needed to live a life of purpose and significance that also contributes to improving the world. In the words of Albert Camus, ""Real generosity toward the future lies in giving all to the present."" Together, we will engage with the problems of danger, uncertainty, failure, and suffering that led the founders of the social sciences and humanities to ask fundamental questions about meaning, imagination, aesthetics, social life and subjective experience. These are the same existential questions that bring ordinary people all over the world, and throughout history, to question commonsense reality in the face of catastrophes and the violenceof everyday life. The many answers to these questions – wisdom that is found in religious, ethical and aesthetic quests, expressions and traditions - are intended to furnish individuals’ art of living with strategies to respond to potential and hope, pain and suffering, to promote healing, and to address concerns about salvation, redemption, or other kinds of moral- emotional transformation.
Together - through discussions, lectures, films, virtual museum visits, readings, and action - we will explore different paths to wisdom, including (1) the youthful quest for truth, beauty and goodness; (2) the affirmation of caregiving for others as the means of applying wisdom to repair and improve the world; 3)suffering and the ordeal of journeying through labyrinths and tests of courage; (4) the discovery of wisdom in teachers and mentors near and far; (5) the process of creative mourning for past losses and shaping new beginnings.",['HDS 3001'],https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu/home/courses?school=FAS&search=ANTHRO+1400,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,Anthropology,Anthropology,Cambridge Campus,4,Lecture,FAS Letter Graded,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,,No Limit,,,,,

The authors we read will argue that the exchange of value(s) between humans creates social solidarity. We are tied to our communities and friends through relationships of debt and expenditure; we give a gift with the expectation of receiving something in return, binding the gift giver and receiver in a social relationship that extends over space and time. For sociologist Marcel Mauss, even gestures of altruism are an attempt to create value and establish (or reinforce) relationships of alliance. We begin the semester with Mauss’s bold contention that no gift is given selflessly; we give in order to receive something in return. Mauss’s The Gift: Forms and Function of Exchange in Archaic Societies is a foundational text of economic social thought; he and the authors who follow him on the syllabus, foreground how social relationships of all sorts are governed by exchange, including relationships between the state and the pensioned worker (Mauss), between friends (Julian Pitt-Rivers), and between members of a community (Roberto Esposito). We then examine the moral and spiritual side of exchange through a close investigation of sacrifice and expenditure through the works of various philosophers, such as Jacques Derrida and Soren Kierkegaard. Ethnographic forays into value supplement these texts and foreground how notions of exchange, obligation, and expenditure guide religious, economic, and political cosmologies across societies. In the last third of the semester we turn to capitalist commodity production and the reified “money-form,” which Karl Marx argues are socially alienating and economically exploitative.

We know, from the work of many anthropologists, that power is not a question of the state. The political anthropologist Pierre Clastres wrote about non-state societies with a deep sense of law, tradition, and propriety that actively combat the emergence of a state system. In an age where we feel constantly surveilled, it is clear that power can be invisible, yet palpable; physical force is not necessary to encourage obedience among a population. In other words, power, specifically political power, is quite a complicated manner. At a moment in global history when traditional political paradigms are being increasingly called into question, this seminar asks us to reflect on power and politics from historical and cultural perspectives that broaden our conception of political identity and political participation. By focusing on the themes of sovereignty, hegemony, and resistance, we move away from traditional notions of power as that which is yielded by individual authority figures or state actors—although, we will certainly spend time reflecting on traditional paradigms of sovereignty. Instead, we contemplate the many shapes political power takes in geographically and ideologically diverse contexts. In doing so, the following questions emerge: Why do so many seem willing to kill and die for political causes? What does it mean to have a political identity? Where is the boundary between complicity and resistance? We will approach these questions through a combination of political theory and ethnography that will place political philosophers in conversation with anthropologists with the aim of elucidating the genealogy of shared preoccupations across the disciplines.",,https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu/home/courses?school=FAS&search=ANTHRO+1709,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,Anthropology,Anthropology,Cambridge Campus,4,Seminar,FAS Letter Graded,Available for Harvard Cross Registration, 5/07/2024 9:00 AM,No Limit,,,,,

These “psy-ences” promote their professional practices (e.g., diagnosis, psychotherapy) as plausible remedies for Indigenous social suffering, but many Indigenous communities remain skeptical of—and resistant to—these clinical approaches, primarily for cultural and political reasons.

What is care? How can and do communities mobilize care as a social intervention, political act, and tool for building intimacy, healing, and hope? Now, more than ever, it is imperative that we care for ourselves and our communities, but caring is not an apolitical or individual act and we must analyze the inherent inequalities and social dimensions of what it means to give and receive care. Employing a feminist mode of inquiry and an engaged anthropology approach, this course requires students to not only ask how they might engage in caring acts with their own communities, but to complete a locally based community project that brings care, in all its multifariousness, to the fore. Readings will focus on ethnographic, scholarly, and public-facing works that illustrate how culture, social relations, and systems of power shape the experiences, roles, practices, and interactions of individuals and their communities in the exchange of care.",,https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu/home/courses?school=FAS&search=ANTHRO+1906,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,Anthropology,Anthropology,Cambridge Campus,4,Seminar,FAS Letter Graded,Available for Harvard Cross Registration,,,,,,,

It offers a selective overview of theoretical and empirical trends in the discipline of anthropology, focusing on intellectual connections between writing and research of faculty members at Harvard and different theoretical genealogies within the discipline at large.  Rather than providing a single historical overview of the classic anthropological corpus, the course will provide an opportunity to read selected writings by faculty members in the Department, as well as writings that faculty members recommend that represent a stream of anthropological writing with which they identify, and to discuss these in the seminar with each faculty member. The course asks what has counted for anthropologists as legitimate research questions, forms of research, ways anthropologists have situated themselves in the field, and approaches to ethnographic writing.
The hope is that students will begin to re-assemble elements of the discipline’s past and present in the form of their own vision of a scholarly agenda for the discipline’s future. Ultimately, the course is designed to prepare students to answer questions such as the following: What should be specifically anthropological questions in the 21st Century? How should anthropology define itself in relation to other scholarly projects, especially those in other social sciences?  What is the relationship between generating knowledge, social critique, and forms of engagement? What should define anthropology’s central intellectual problematics?

This course is built upon the model of balancing conceptual understanding, theoretical knowledge, and hands-on implementation. It introduces students to the iterative process of model development, testing, deployment, monitoring, and updating, ensuring they acquire a strong foundation in MLOps principles.",,https://qreports.fas.harvard.edu/home/courses?school=FAS&search=APCOMP+215,Faculty of Arts & Sciences,Applied Computation,Applied Computation,Allston Campus,4,Lecture,FAS Letter Graded,Available for Harvard Cross Registration, 12/13/2023 9:00 AM,,,,"AC 209A, AC 209B",,
